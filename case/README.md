## case design notes

* 2 piece - front and back; fit over the nylon screw parts
  * back should be fully covered
  * front can be mostly open; bezel around the whole face
    * don't need to fit closely around buttons and joystick
    * try to print thin over NeoPixel on top (right of @arturo182), so it shines through
    * make sure keyboard is not blocked by case
      * check corner keys like Q, P, alt, RETURN, shift and space
* colors - please make:
  * one in black
  * one in either army green, dark blue or ??? (something cyberdeck-ish)
* sides
  * leave space on side for Stemma-QT port
  * leave space on top for on/off switch, USB and microSD
* cyberdeck look - do your best interpretation; chonky
