## case design notes

* 2 piece - front and back; fit over the nylon screw parts
  * back should be fully covered
    * watch out for corner near USB and battery sockets
  * front can be mostly open / bezel around the whole face
    * don't need to fit closely around buttons and joystick
    * try to print thin over NeoPixel on top (right of @arturo182), so it shines through
    * make sure keyboard is not blocked by case
      * check corner keys like Q, P, alt, RETURN, shift and space
* circuit board dimensions and design files:

* colors - please make:
  * one in black
  * one in either army green, dark blue or ??? (something cyberdeck-ish?)
* sides
  * leave space on side for Stemma-QT port
  * leave space on top for on/off switch, USB and microSD
* cyberDeck look - chonky?
  * don't overthink it, but refer to https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/ if in need of inspiration
